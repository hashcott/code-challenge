# Problem 6: Scoreboard API Architecture

## Overview
This is a technical specification for a scoreboard API module with real-time update capabilities and security measures to prevent score manipulation.

## Documentation Created

### 1. Detailed Technical Specification
- **File**: `API_SPECIFICATION.md`
- **Content**: Complete API endpoints specification, database schema, security implementation, and performance considerations

### 2. Execution Flow Diagrams
- **File**: `FLOW_DIAGRAM.md` 
- **Content**: Mermaid diagrams illustrating processing flows, security validation, real-time updates, and error handling

## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Scoreboard**: Display top 10 users with highest scores
2. **Live Updates**: Real-time updates without page refresh
3. **Score Updates**: API endpoint to update scores when actions are completed
4. **Security**: Prevent unauthorized score manipulation

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Support concurrent users with low latency
2. **Scalability**: Handle increasing user load
3. **Security**: Robust authentication and authorization
4. **Reliability**: High availability and data consistency

## Improvement Recommendations

### 1. Enhanced Security
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Add two-factor authentication for critical operations
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Identify devices to detect abnormal behavior
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Analyze user behavior to detect fraud
- **Blockchain Verification**: Use blockchain to verify score legitimacy

### 2. Performance Optimization
- **Database Sharding**: Partition database by user ID for better scalability
- **CDN Integration**: Use CDN for static scoreboard data
- **Microservices Architecture**: Split into independent services
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Use message queues for asynchronous processing

### 3. Feature Extensions
- **Score History**: Track user score history
- **Achievement System**: Badge and achievement system
- **Team Scoreboards**: Group/team-based scoreboards
- **Mobile App Support**: Mobile application support
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Data analytics dashboard

### 4. Scalability Improvements
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale horizontally with load balancers
- **Database Read Replicas**: Use replicas for read operations
- **Multi-level Caching**: Multi-tier caching system (L1, L2, L3)
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatic scaling based on system load

### 5. Monitoring and Observability
- **Distributed Tracing**: Track requests across services
- **Real-time Metrics**: Real-time metrics with Prometheus/Grafana
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with ELK stack
- **Health Checks**: Automated system health monitoring

### 6. Testing Strategy
- **Chaos Engineering**: Test system resilience under failure conditions
- **Load Testing**: Performance testing under high load
- **Security Testing**: Security testing with OWASP ZAP
- **Performance Testing**: Performance testing with JMeter

### 7. DevOps and Deployment
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate build, test, and deployment
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployment
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout to subset of users
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Manage infrastructure through code

### 8. Data Management
- **Data Archiving**: Archive old data to optimize performance
- **Data Backup**: Automated backup and recovery
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance and privacy regulations
- **Data Analytics**: Data analysis to improve user experience

## Conclusion

This specification provides a solid foundation for implementing a secure, scalable, and real-time scoreboard system. The modular design allows for incremental development and future enhancements while maintaining security and performance standards.
